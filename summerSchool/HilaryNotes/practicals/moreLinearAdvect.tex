\section{Practical: More Linear Advection}

In the first practical and in the numerical analysis, we identified
a number of problems and shortfalls of FTBS and CTCS and this has
motivated the presentation of some alternative advection schemes:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Semi-Lagrangian (using linear or cubic Lagrange interpolation)
\item Artificial diffusion (using $\nabla^{2}$ or $\nabla^{4}$ diffusion) 
\item A TVD scheme
\end{enumerate}
Write a python function in \url{mySchemes.py} to solve the linear
advection using one of the new schemes. Is your chosen scheme better
in any aspect that FTBS and CTCS? For example, you could consider:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Accuracy measured as a root mean square error norm
\item Order of accuracy
\item Boundedness
\item Total variation
\item Conservation of mean and standard deviation
\item Stability constraints - what is the longest stable time-step that
can be taken?
\item Behaviour in the presence of varying resolution
\end{enumerate}
Share code with your neighbours to study the behaviour of different
schemes. 

You will have the opportunity to present the results of your work
to the whole group. So in collaboration with your colleagues, make
some figures and some slides which answer the above questions.%
